**Find Camp - Unity Game**

This small 3D adventure game was built with Unity. The objective is to find the path to the camp. The primary goal of the project was to practice building a Low Poly game world and implementing character movement and physics mechanics. This project was developed as part of a game programming course.


🛠️ **Features**

- Character Controller: WASD movement and jump mechanics.
- AI Enemies: Bears that attack if the player gets too close (implemented using distance calculation), which restarts the game.
- Interactive Objects: Players can pick up stones that block their path and drop them by pressing the "Q" key.
- Pause Menu: The game pauses and a menu opens by pressing the "P" key.

🏗️ **Technologies Used**

- Game Engine: Unity 6.2
- Programming: C#

🚀 **Getting Started**

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jonijjoke/unity-game-practice.git
- Open the project via Unity Hub.
- Press play.

🔮 **Future Improvements & Known Issues**

- Animations: Currently only the bears have an "idle" animation. Character movement is functional but lacks walking/running animations.
- World Design: Further polishing and detailing of the game environment.
